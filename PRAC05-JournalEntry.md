# Week 6 - Practical 4

During the past week, I engaged with a range of resources to expand my knowledge of WordPress child themes. I made use of YouTube videos and consulted the WordPress documentation to understand the purpose and 
role of child themes clearly. Additionally, I dedicated time to researching the broader concept of child themes, gaining valuable insights into their significance in website development and acquiring practical skills in 
effectively managing them.

## Estimated Hours:

I overall spent 5 hours learning and creating my WordPress child theme based on the twenty-twenty theme. 

3 hours spent watching YouTube videos
2 hours spent creating and editing my WordPress child theme

## Content Insights:

Utilising WordPress child themes proved to be a valuable approach for enhancing my website's theme and functionality without modifying the core files of the parent theme. I used the standard twenty-twenty theme which is built 
into WordPress to conduct this practical. This allowed me to easily incorporate custom CSS code, enabling substantial modifications to my site to improve the basic theme and customise it to my liking. Moreover, working with child 
themes served as a beneficial introduction to PHP programming and significantly contributed to my understanding of the language.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights:

Through this practical, I realised the significance of child themes in website development, and it is evident that major companies consider them a standard practice for their websites.

Child themes provide developers with a valuable tool to make modifications to websites without impacting the overall design of the template. The ability to customize styles while preserving the core design can greatly enhance the 
user experience and create a distinctive look and feel for the website. This newfound knowledge will greatly benefit my future career, as it will improve my ability to create visually appealing and functional custom templates for websites.

Reflecting on my learning approach this week, I found that, I am more focused and efficient when following YouTube video guides in comparison to reading online guides. Especially with this practical since I had no prior experience in 
creating child themes. I have found this method to be the most effective because, when attempting to follow a written guide from the documentation, I often became confused. Additionally, the written guide lacked the engagement I experience 
when following video tutorials. Overall, I have discovered that my learning is most efficient when following explanatory video guides. I have saved some of these guides for future reference in case I need to revisit them for my assignment.
