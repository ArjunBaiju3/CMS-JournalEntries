# Week 9 - Practical 8

## Learning Activities

During this week, I made use of various resources available to me through learnJCU such as recorded lectures, readings, and documentation.  I further looked at YouTube videos and online articles/guides, to assess whether I could enhance my learning approach for all subjects within my course. These resources proved beneficial in starting assignments and aiding me in staying ahead, which has been a struggle for me. I recognize the importance of developing effective learning practices for myself, both for future studies and the workforce.

## Estimated Hours

This week I spent 6 hours trying to get up to date with subject content and assignments.

## Content Insights:

The strategy I chose is dividing work into 25-minute intervals called Pomodoro’s, followed by a 5-minute break. After finishing four Pomodoro’s, you take a 15-30 minute break. During each Pomodoro interval of 25 minutes, you work on a single task without interruptions or distractions.

The Pomodoro Technique assists people in staying focused, reducing procrastination, and avoiding exhaustion. It is a basic yet efficient strategy for managing time and increasing productivity. The technique can be used for a variety of tasks ranging from learning and writing to programming and design.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

The hypothesis for my test is If I use the Pomodoro technique to complete tasks for the project and practicals, I will be able to focus on tasks more consistently making me hand them in on time. I will use the Pomodoro technique to complete a task that I need to finish. I will work for 25 minutes without distractions, then take a 5-minute break to rest and relax. After four 25-minute intervals, I will take a longer break of 15-20 minutes before resuming work.

To measure the effectiveness of this experiment, I will track my progress over one week. I recorded information such as the task completion duration, the date, the task and an estimated time to complete it. I also measured the amount of content I covered, work I completed and my understanding of the material covered.

After using the Pomodoro technique for a week, I could see improvements in my workflow since I found myself concentrating more on tasks on hand rather than getting exhausted or distracted. To test this, I compared the time it took to complete a task with and without the Pomodoro technique. I found that using the Pomodoro technique took me under an hour, while completing the same task without the technique took me two hours. These results show that technique does increase concentration and productivity levels. I have gained valuable insight into the benefits of time management and the impact it can have on my academic and career endeavours. This is necessary for university studies as there is a lot of content and material to cover over in a limited time. This technique can also be applied in the workforce for future projects. The pomodoro technique is something previously ignored but I will be taking full advantage of it for the rest of my university degree. I will use this technique to complete tasks for my web design project within this subject and other upcoming assessment.  Developing efficient learning and time management practises is critical in any area to remain organised and productive, making me a great asset to any team or organisation.

Through my experimentation with the Pomodoro technique, I have gained valuable insights into the benefits of time management and the impact it can have on my academic and career success. I also learnt how important it is to measure my progress and set realistic goals for success. Overall, this week's learning activities and experimentation with the Pomodoro technique have provided me with a solid foundation for continued personal and professional growth.
