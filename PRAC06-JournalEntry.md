# Week 7 - Practical 6

## Learning Activities

During the practical session of this week, I engaged in effective communication with my team members to exchange our thoughts and plans regarding 
our group project. By collaborating and sharing ideas, we successfully discussed how meetings will work, reviewed the task at hand, outlined basic 
concepts for the site, and determined the necessary tools required to achieve our objectives. As a team, we decided to use Vagrant and AWS to stage our website, 
and we planned to set up a GitHub repository and IDE during the next meeting once we had set up an AWS instance.

## Content Insights:

During the first meeting, it was already apparent the team was driven towards completing this project with flying colours. We openly shared our 
ideas and were eager to cooperate in finding a solution. Whenever required, we made sure everyone's perspective was considered. This fostered a positive 
and driven work atmosphere, making each team member feel valued for their individual strengths. We established well-defined expectations and efficiently worked towards accomplishing our objectives, 
resulting in substantial progress being made towards our goals.

Within this project I was introduced to Trello by a group member, this was my first time working with this tool. For 
team-based collaboration and project management, Trello is a powerful tool that offers a user-friendly visual interface for tracking tasks, 
prioritizing work, and collaborating with team members. Trello's flexible design allows for customization to fit the specific needs of any project, and its real-time updating capabilities make it effortless for team members to add, assign, and modify tasks as needed. This ensures that everyone is on the same page and working towards 
the same objectives leading to efficient and successful project outcomes.

Before embarking on the project, it was necessary to ensure that we had all the tools and software required to successfully complete it. 
Efficient software development necessitates the establishment of an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for foundational code editing. GitHub 
is a widely used platform that seamlessly integrates with numerous IDEs, making it an essential tool for managing code changes during software development collaborations. The integration of GitHub with an IDE allows team members to effectively organize their work, track code changes, and establish a stable and 
secure codebase. This is mandatory for such a huge project such as this.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

Strong project management and collaboration skills are frequently sought after by employers across numerous industries and job roles. 
My utilization of GitHub and Trello in various projects has provided me with hands-on experience in these areas, increasing my appeal as a 
candidate to potential employers. Furthermore, my use of these tools showcases my ability to work productively and collaboratively within a team, a highly valued quality in many work settings. In summary, the skills and experiences gained from employing GitHub 
and Trello can significantly augment my career opportunities.

After reviewing my learning approach this week, I realized that my group members were extremely supportive, providing 
assistance with any queries or issues I faced while setting up software and development tools. This collaborative approach is 
characteristic of effective teamwork, where everyone contributes to achieving the common goal. In essence, I discovered that 
my learning is most effective when I am comfortable seeking help from my peers.
