## Content Insights

During the second practical session, I utilized Joomla CMS to construct a personalized website for my startup. Joomla CMS is a widely used content management system which allow me to gain valuable experience. To begin, I selected the only Joomla template that was accessible and customized it to fit my startup's branding and messaging. I changed the color scheme, fonts, and images to match the branding and messaging of my startup.

While customizing the template, I encountered a few challenges due to my limited knowledge of Joomla. For instance, I found it difficult to customize the website's layout and to add certain functionalities that I wanted. However, through research and experimentation, I was able to modify most of the website's design elements. For instance, I was able to add a contact form and customize the footer section of the website.

Upon reflecting on the practical, I concluded that Joomla is a viable tool for creating a website, but it may not be the most efficient or user-friendly option for more intricate projects. I believe that this could be a result of my limited software expertise, as I am still learning how to use Joomla effectively. In the future, I aim to investigate other CMS choices, such as WordPress, to evaluate their effectiveness and complexity in comparison. Overall, I am pleased with the simple website that I created using Joomla, that sets up a foundation for my final website.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

I realised that using CMS platforms like Joomla can be a valuable skill in terms of employability. As businesses increasingly shift to online platforms, the demand for web developers and designers is growing rapidly. By gaining experience with CMS platforms like Joomla, I am developing skills that are in high demand in today's job market.

I plan on altering my learning strategy for the future through learning more skills. Moreover, the platform's extensive selection of templates and plugins presented me with numerous opportunities to enhance the uniqueness and distinctiveness of my website, which I plan to explore further as I work on the final version. This experience helped me to develop problem-solving and critical thinking skills, which are highly valued by employers.

Overall, the second practical was an excellent learning experience that allowed me to expand my knowledge of web development and CMS platforms such as Joomla. I believe that using CMS platforms is an efficient and effective way to create websites, particularly for those with limited knowledge of web development. I look forward to utilizing Joomla and other CMS platforms in future projects, and I am confident that my experience with Joomla will prove invaluable in my future endeavors.
