# Week 5 - Practical 4

## Learning Activities

During the past week, I focused on learning about setting up a localhost for WordPress integration, which involved watching instructional YouTube tutorials. 
I also took the time to research and explore the different aspects of Vagrant, with a particular emphasis on understanding the role of VirtualBox in the context 
of local hosting.

## Estimated Hours

I spent 6 hours researching and setting up my localhost WordPress website  with Vagrant.

## Content Insights:

Creating a local environment was an insightful introduction to the inner workings of a dynamic website with an integrated database. 
I learnt how to install and set up a local host for WordPress integration by viewing YouTube videos and Vagrant guides. In addition, I learnt how to save and retrieve data using a database, making it easy to manage and alter information on the website. Vagrant, 
which allowed me to easily construct, manage, and share virtual development environments, was one tool that substantially aided my local hosting experience. 
This made it easier to test and troubleshoot my website before deployment, eliminating the requirement for an internet connection, and making it more accessible.


## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

Learning how to use Vagrant and host locally is a crucial skill for web developers. It not only enables local website 
development and testing, but it also facilitates comprehension of server setups and database management, both of which are critical 
skills in the web development profession.

Upon reflecting on my learning strategy, I realized that visual aids were more beneficial for me than written documentation, 
mainly because of my limited experience with local hosting. I found that alternating between working on my project and watching YouTube 
tutorials with relevant visual aids was the most effective technique for me. Unlike written instructions, which can be perplexing and time-consuming, well-crafted visual aids enabled me to pause and follow along effortlessly, 
leading to a more productive learning experience.
