# Week 2 - Practical 1 Basic Site

## Learning Activities

This practical involves creating a simple website for my startup business, which is also the basis for the assignment. 
To refresh my memory on how to use HTML and CSS to develop a website, I had to consult tools like W3Schools and previous website projects.
My memory was jogged back in no time. Also, I used GitHub Pages for the first time and discovered how to use GitHub's many features more efficiently. 
I built a simple website with three pages using some complex and basic HTML and CSS. I spent some time investigating various design elements that would be suitable for the website of my startup, and I then applied what I learned to create an appealing website that effectively conveyed the message and reached its target audience.

## Estimated Hours

I spent approximately 8 hours this week on creating and refining my website (4 hours reviewing how to use HTML and CSS).

## Content Insights

Updating my memory of HTML enabled me to edit the website's content to produce a more aesthetically pleasing design. 
To build the website for my start up, I utilised Notepad++. As it lacks git integration and debugging features, I found that this software is not the best option for 
building websites. These limitations made it challenging to optimise my code. The website itself has an intuitive layout and a really attractive background that fits 
in, giving it a really polished appearance. For better functionality and readability of my code, I used CSS to modify the website's visual design on a separate page. 
This enabled me to produce a consistent design and save time by not having to rectify mistakes all the time.The website consists of three pages: Home, Special setups, and Contact us. I was also introcuded to Github pages to host my website easily and markdown language, which is very efficent way to record my journal entries every week.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

My ability to enhance and reinforce my expertise ultimately determines my ability to expand my software development capabilities. A wonderful way to learn more 
about web development was to create a website from scratch without utilising pre-made templates. This will greatly increase my employability because it will boost 
my familiarity with programming languages that are relevant to web development. By examining the easily available materials, I was able to expand my knowledge and 
skills beyond what I had learnt in practical and previous courses. By combining experience with tutorials and valuable online resources, I was able to swiftly develop 
a startup website and gain a deeper understanding of website programming.The primary strategy that suited my learning style when I needed to develop a specific attribute in my code was to review the notes I had compiled from various sources. I also applied appropriate programming techniques, such as assuring my code is clear, efficient, and responsiove, to ensure I could work on projects efficiently and guarantee they offered a good solution. I can identify areas for potential improvement at this stage by reflecting back on the outcomes of previous projects; this will be advantageous when I'm engaged on larger projects for clients the IT sector.
